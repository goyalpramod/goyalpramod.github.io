For the lost one's

I am a fan of philosophy and there was a shift in the ideas from "how to live" to "why live" from the renauissane to the modern world. This is rather melocholic imo, Even though I asked you to question everything have a why for everything. There are certain things to which you must give the why yourself, I will give you my small why and help you discover your why along with telling you about the how in many important aspects of life in my opinoin

How to find love
How to find purpose
How to find happiness
How to do the right thing -->
