My biggest limitations as an MLE had been that I wasn't proficient in Web Development. I have tried to transition into it back in the day a few times. But have always stopped midway either due to lack of time or interest. 

Also given the pace of AI innovation, I very rarely had a few months in which I could dedicate time to learning web development. 

But funny enough, AI has caught up to webd and it has become easier to develop websites than ever before using tools like [cursor](), [v0](), [replit]() etc. 

So I have set a challenge for myself to learn web development in 15 days. And here I will share everything I learn each day.
