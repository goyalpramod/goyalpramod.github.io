I have always had some extreme thoughts about jobs, as a kid I often used to wonder why adults do jobs they didn't like. I was even more so perplexed by adults who did jobs which in my opinion no one would like. 

Now I worked at places that I absolutely dispised(Thankfully not more than a few months), and I have worked at places that I loved a lot. I have been working since I was quite young so I have picked up a few important lessons. 

The most important one being, how to find a job, which doesnt really feel like a job. Let us begin 


## How to get a job 

If I had a nickle for everytime I have been asked this question, I probably wouldn't ever need to work again. But I am here to guide not rant, so let's first change perspectives. Think that you are not seeking a job, but rather giving one to someone else.
What will be the values that you would be looking for? 

- The person should be competent, lest you wish them to burn the building down. 
- The person should LIKE what he/she does, otherwise why will they
- The person should be able to work with OTHER people, lest everyone leaves because of one person. 
{add more that you believe in}

Common values like "hardworking", "punctual", "time management" do not matter in the grand scheme of things in my opinion. {Think about these for a while}

What I was trying to get across from this part was, if you think from the employer's perspective. It becomes easier to communicate and talk in an interview. Now let's talk about how do we even get to the interview stage. 

I have worked in the tech industry so I know mostly about tech, the above ideas can be applied in most places. But the below one's may not be relevant. 

Even before getting hired, you have to decide where you want to work and how much *risk* you are willing to take.  

If you want to work for fang.... 

if you wish to work with a startup.... 

Build your network.... this is how.... who are you?...

Let them come to you...
