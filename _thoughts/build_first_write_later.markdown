I am putting a small hiatus on my curated blogs, here I explain my rationale.

### Why I started writing

I had started this blog as a resource I wish I had when I started out with ML,CS,AI programming in general. And I have spent almost a year trying to be as close as possible to that vision. 

I absolutely loved doing this in the initial months because I knew what I was working upto. An understanding of extremely complex mechanism. 

But over time I have grown to disdain writing, I still like it. But I see it more of a chore than something I love. I believe primarily because of two reasons: 

* Writing for writing's sake 
* Writing to impress

Earlier I was writing so I could understand and build (My first 3 blogs perfectly reflect that vision of mine). But with my latest one (Evolution of LLMs), I started to write to maximize engagement. Even though I learned a lot, I was not enjoying the process. Primarily because of three reasons. 

* It takes an immense amount of **time** to make each section as perfect as I want it to be. 
* While writing, I am **not actually coding** the ideas. Which creates a dissonance in my mind that I am writing about something that I have not built. Hence I do not truly understand. 
* Anytime a new idea/paper/work comes out, I am **not able to try** it out because I have to finish my blog ASAP so I can write about this idea. And by the time I reach that idea, months would go by. 

### What's going to happen 

I will add another section called projects, where I write about what I am building as I am building it. They will mostly be unstructured, Filled with tangents, spread out thoughts of what I am building, What I am reading to build it and how it's going. 
You can read them if you wish to, but I really cannot promise any good comprehension. 

I will still write my more well curated `blogs` but not at the same frequency, I have lots of idea about what I want to write, and I will continue writing them on my own leisure time over the years!

Thank you for reading what I write, hope you have been enjoying them!
