Recently I watch a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_XMqRhLhic) and [Michael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Seibel) said that "people do not change much over the years", I believe that is not entirely true. Perhaps the core being of a person doesn't change. But we all go through changes through out life. This is an attempt to document how I have changed over the years.

## 21

In this period of time, I have a very obsessive personality. I am not stubborn with my believes but stubborn with my goals. If sufficiently strong points are provided to me I am willing to learn and change. These are my current believes and values.

##### My Believes

- I want to change the world
- Startups change the world
- AI will be that change

##### My Values

- Honor and glory must reflect in each aspect on one's being
- Integrity and mutual respect in all relations
- Long term goals over short term gratification
- Do the hard thing first

##### My Interests

Since I was a child, everything in life has fascinated me. I used to practice [Cardistry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0KSaqiv5C0), [Magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAN-PwRfJcA), [Guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZcUmNIBegY), [Cube](https://in.speedcube.com.au/pages/how-to-solve-a-rubiks-cube) (A few videos that got me absolutely obsessed). I believe that hasn't changed much about me, Now I am obsessed with Photography, [Filmmaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hif5eI5pBxo), Business and AI. Honestly I have to limit myself to the things I want to focus on because there is only so much time and energy that I have.

I do also spend a lot of time reading. And I believe the 3 books that have shaped my thoughts for this time period are

- [The Almanack Of Naval Ravikant](https://www.navalmanack.com/)
- [Zero to One](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296)
- [The Millionaire Fastlane](https://www.amazon.in/Millionaire-Fastlane-Crack-Wealth-Lifetime/dp/0984358102)

I am trying to finish this [top 50 books](https://www.escapingordinary.net/top-50-books) read list, I do not believe in the concept of "Best", "Top", "Must Read". As books are very subjective and personal, but these books reflect well what I am trying to learn at the moment and how I wish to grow as a person.

##### My Goals

I believe goals are a big part of how I live every moment. So here are a few

- Provide real education to millions
- Make my mother happy
- Live in milan, get a yacht, have a chef named "maurice" and eat pizza everyday
- Live the dreams of my friends with them
- Find love

##### My Faults

This is start to feel condescending hahaha, Well maybe that is a few flaws that I know about myself right now. 

Things I am trying to improve about myself:

- Handling personal relationships
- Working on my people skill
- Improving my focus

I am aware that I am man with many "wrongs" I am still trying to figure them out and work on them slowly. I hope the next time I read this, I have achieved a few of the things that I wanted to.
