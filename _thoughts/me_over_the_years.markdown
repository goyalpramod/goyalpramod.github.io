Recently I watch a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_XMqRhLhic) and [Michael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Seibel) said that "people do not change much over the years", I believe that is not entirely true. Perhaps the core being of a person doesn't change. But we all go through changes through out life. This is an attempt to document how I have changed over the years.
