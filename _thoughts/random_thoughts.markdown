What is a correct answer

The difference between an answer and a statement that does not answer a question is how satisfied you are with an answer.
Let me elaborate, if you were to ask "how do magnets work"
And someone said "oh it's just a property"
If you were satisfied with it, then that is your answer. But some one more curious may say, "But how did this property came to be"
You ask this, because the answer does not satisfy you
Someone answer "Well we have so and so atomic arangements and then there are these 4 fundamental forces in nature"
If you are satisfied with it, then that is your answer. But if you are not, you may ask "How do you know there are only 4 fundamental forces, and how did these come to be"
I have come to realise it is not only about facts but other things in life that can tell us when we are satified, like asking your friend
"Why did you not pick up my call"
"Oh I was busy"
"It was 12 PM at night, what could you possibly be busy with"
"I got some news and was on a call"
"What kind of news did you get at 12 dude"
"My grandpa died"
I obviously implore you to understand the fine line between prying and understanding But the only thing that defines an answer is our subjective feeling towards it.
If you go to a computer scientist and say 1 + 1 = 0, He would be satified with the answer and not stop you from making such a statement. Go to a JS developer and tell him 1 + 1 = 11 and he will be fine. But if a mathematician witnessed all this he will make pie out of you -->
